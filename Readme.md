# moon

3d moon animation with libration and position angle, browser based.

[Live demo](https://yingchangj.github.io/moon)

texture downloaded in [NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4720/)

Use three.js and astronomy-engine.

Try to mimic Nasa's moon video.

Larger image could give better quality of the Moon (but since this is a web-based, I choose the smallest one)
